# seattle-seasonal-crime
Investigating how crime in seattle is related to the different seasons/time periods 


REPO: https://github.com/walzejon/seattle-seasonal-crime 


Data: https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Crime-Stats-by-Police-Precinct-2008-Presen/3xqu-vnum 

* The data is collected by the Seattle Police Department and by the Seattle City government offices. The data was accessed from data.seattle.gov the official website for data collected by the City of Seattle. This data was drawn from police reports and records from the year 2008 to the current year of 2019, updated as recently as May 10, 2019. 

* Our targeted audience would be any prospective Seattle tourist and local residents. Understanding the seasonality and severity of crime in the city allows for better attention to specific areas/times by the police, and when to avoid by tourists and locals which in turn could lead to a safer Seattle. 

* What questions, if any, will you be answering with statistical analysis/machine learning?
  - The areas containing the most crime. 
  - The severity and type of the most common  crimes. 
  - The amount of severe crimes during tourist season vs the rest of the year. 
  - When the highest level of crime is taking place. 

Course of Action:  
1. Get the csv file read. 
2. Define classifications for crime type (either a scale or just severe/not severe) and for seasons (whether or not we want a specific time frame for tourist season or not)
3. Filter through data by these variables
4. Create either an rmd file with images of plots we made or a shiny app (this is preferred according to the assignment page) 
5. Put together an analysis, through chosen format from 4, in a way that answers all of the questions above.
6. Make sure all important issues are closed on github and that there are no merge conflicts
7. Work on getting our presentation done (either have a script or at least do a dry run)
